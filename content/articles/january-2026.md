January re-cap. Enjoy!

<!-- Hanz + Chris -->
Hanz and Chris kicked off the ride the right way — parked at Pedal and Pour with buttery ham and cheese croissants in hand, soaking up that quiet pre-ride buzz before the miles began. It wasn’t about rushing out the door, just good coffee, flaky crumbs on jerseys, and that shared look that says the day’s ride is already off to a perfect start.

After Pedal and Pour, Hanz and Chris made a completely unnecessary but perfectly on-brand stop at a casino, slipping inside for a quick gamble.

A few laughs (and a few lost dollars) later, they clipped back in and rolled off for a quick stop at Kiln.

After Kiln, the ride took a turn with a sudden flat.

No drama though, just two cyclists pushing their bikes back home, another good story added to the day.

Next up, Hanz and Hanz (the bro duo) went out for a ride.

A ride all the way out to Seven Magic Mountains for a mini photoshoot.

Woah, someone got a new helmet!

Fun little vegas night ride with Chris and Hanz. Gotta fuel up before hitting the road.

Later that night, Hanz and Chris rolled back out into the chilly Vegas air, trading the chaos of the Strip for quiet side streets and glowing traffic lights. It wasn’t a hard ride or a chase for miles — just an easy spin, soft music from passing cars, and long stretches of empty road where the city finally felt calm. Pedaling through neon reflections and silent neighborhoods, they let the pace drop and the conversation wander, soaking in one of those rare, perfectly chill Vegas rides.

Chris and Hanz set out early with no real rush, pointing their bikes south for a long, wandering day ride that stitched together some of their favorite local stops — White Castle for a quick, slightly questionable mid-ride bite, a smooth cruise past Jean Airport, and the always-surreal colors of Seven Magic Mountains glowing in the desert sun.

The miles quietly stacked up between each stop, the wind picked up, legs started to fade, and what began as a casual plan turned into a properly long Vegas day in the saddle, the kind that leaves you dusty, tired, and already talking about the next one.

That sums up January! Stay tuned for Feburaury's re-cap.

Much love, Cycle Code ❤️.
