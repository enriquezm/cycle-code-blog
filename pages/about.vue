    <h1>About.</h1>
    <p>This started as friends riding bikes. Nothing more than that.</p>
    <p>Coffee stops that turned into long conversations. Rides that went nowhere on purpose. An appreciation for how bikes look, how they feel, and the places they take you.</p>
    <p>We care about fashion as much as function. Adventure over efficiency. Friendship over metrics.</p>
    <p>There's a place here for going fast — but most of the time, we're choosing to slow down. To ride together. To step out of the rush and into something simpler.</p>
    <p>This isn't a team. It's a rhythm.</p>
    <p>If that rhythm sounds familiar, ride with us.</p>
